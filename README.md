This team project is part of the ALX Full-Stack Software Engineering program. It's the first step towards building a first full web application: an AirBnB clone. This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data.

Usage The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell. It prints a prompt (hbnb) and waits for the user for input.

Command Example Run the console ./console.py Quit the console (hbnb) quit Display the help for a command (hbnb) help Create an object (prints its id) (hbnb) create Show an object (hbnb) show or (hbnb) .show() Destroy an object (hbnb) destroy or (hbnb) .destroy() Show all objects, or all instances of a class (hbnb) all or (hbnb) all Update an attribute of an object
